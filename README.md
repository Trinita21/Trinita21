# 👋 Hi, I'm Trinita Roy

**AI/ML Researcher | Computational Linguistics | University of Stuttgart| Generative AI, LLMs, Multimodal LLMs, and Privacy-Safe Adversarially Robust AI**

---

🎯 I'm an AI researcher with over 3 years of experience building high-impact AI systems — from production-grade **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **multimodal agents**, to **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems, **automatic speech recognition**, **speech technology**, and **adversarial robustness** tooling.

I specialize in transforming research into real-world applications — blending **cutting-edge NLP, Speech & Vision**, with **scalable model engineering**, and **safety-first principles**.

## 📌 Highlight Projects

### 🔐 [Whisper Redaction Attack (Voice Privacy)](https://github.com/Trinita21/prepend_acoustic_attack)
> **Goal**: Inaudible redaction triggers that prevent Whisper from transcribing sensitive content  
→ Designed audio-level triggers to simulate redaction on "Off" cues and restore on "On" cues  
→ Evaluated using custom ASR attack metrics (ASR, PRP, Leakage)

---

### 🤖 [Curator Agent (AI Tech Digest)](https://github.com/Trinita21/CuratorAgent)
> An agentic assistant that gathers trending AI news, summarizes them, and emails users a quick digest.  
→ Uses LangGraph + RAG + summarization  
→ Voice generation coming soon via TTS pipeline

---

### 📚 [GraphRAG for Medical Literature](https://github.com/Trinita21/GraphRAG)
> Integrates structured knowledge graphs + RAG for factuality and retrieval depth  
→ Reduced hallucination in medical QA pipelines by 20%

---

### 🎞️ [AI Video Slide Generator](https://typeset.io/pdf-to-video)
> PDF-to-video AI pipeline with avatar-based lip-syncing  
→ End-to-end NLP + GenAI + speech generation

---

### 🛡️ [Adversarial Attacks on LLMs](https://github.com/Trinita21/Adversarial-Attacks-LLMs)
> Toolkit for LLM red-teaming with prompt injection, paraphrase jailbreaking, and speech-based attacks  
→ Ongoing work on attack evaluation dashboard + mitigation scorecards
