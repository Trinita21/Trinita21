# 👋 Hi, I'm Trinita Roy

**AI/ML Researcher | Computational Linguistics | University of Stuttgart| Generative AI, LLMs, Multimodal LLMs, and Privacy-Safe Adversarially Robust AI**

---

🎯 I'm an AI researcher with over 3 years of experience building high-impact AI systems — from production-grade **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **multimodal agents**, to **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems, **automatic speech recognition**, **speech technology**, and **adversarial robustness** tooling.

I specialize in transforming research into real-world applications — blending **cutting-edge NLP, Speech & Vision**, with **scalable model engineering**, and **safety-first principles**.
